# Object-Detection-Data-Augmentation
This is a python based library to augment the dataset used to train a classifier for object detection using YOLO.
The library used the code from https://github.com/eborboihuc/rotate_3d for perfroming perspective transform on the sample files before placing them in various backgrounds. Thanks to Hou-Ning Hu for making the code available.
